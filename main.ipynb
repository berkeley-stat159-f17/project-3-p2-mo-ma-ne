    "We first consider the number of IPOs by region. The data provided in the 'cb_ipos' table is lacking the valuation amount for many companies. When filtering for entries that have valuation amount included, we have an N of 167. We continue with this valuation analyis but will subsequently look at total funding in part 2 for a larger dataset that may also indicate company success. We find that SF Bay has the highest number of companies that IPO (34) with NYC in second (11) and London in third (8). In the below barplot, we consider the regions that had >5 companies IPO in order of decreasing number of companies. Seattle has the highest average valuation for companies that IPO; however, if we consider a barplot of the same data we see that Seattle with 7 companies is more sensitive to outliers and has a broader distribution. This additional analysis can be found in the supplementary notebook 'location_time.ipynb.'\n",

    "### 3. Investor portfolio correlations\n",
    "If a company can get a certain investor, are there other investors the company is likely to get as well? We consider the correlation among investors using multidimensional scaling with the ultimate goal of determing whether certain investor portfolios cluster. We create a company matrix, whose columns are company vectors for each investing company. Each matrix entry is a count of the number of occurences of each company in the investor portfolio. The resulting matrix is very sparse; it is compose of 99.76% zeros. We normalize the matrix to represent the probability of investing in a given company for each given investor. Using Multidimensional Scaling with both euclidean distance and Jensen-Shannon distance calcuations, no clusters are evident. \n",

We also try a variety of subsets of the data in the hopes that some correlations may arise. For example we consider just the top 5% of companies in terms of funding total, just companies in CA, just biotech companies, etc. For each of the filters we tried, no clusters formed. Therefore, we do not identify any correlations among investor portfolios."

    "### 4. Executive Education\n",
    "Executives at some of the highest performing businesses need to get their starts somewhere. For some, like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, their backgrounds do not include a college degree. This however seems to be the minority. Still, the premise begs the question: are there schools which tend to produce more successful business executives? Is there a direct correlation between which institution you receive a degree from and eventual success? \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, we first need to define a benchmark for a company's success. This could simply be whether the company is still operating or not (presumably companies that are not still operating were unsuccessful), or it could also be related to the company's total valuation. Instead, we use the total funding acquired in all funding rounds for a company. Note that this is itself an imperfect metric. Some highly successful companies might require less capital investment than others, so this statistic could be biased in favor of capital intensive companies. We will assume that this is not so overwhelming to render the metric worthless. Funding totals for the top 100 businesses are plotted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='results/funding_totals.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this metric, we find that slightly more than 25% of the companies in the Crunchbase dataset raised over $10 million in funding rounds, and so we select this subset as \"the top businesses\". For the more than 7,000 companies in that sample, we match individuals (who are paired with degree information) to those companies. Together, the degree information for successful companies let's us create a visual to show how many degrees each university has conferred to affiliates of all companies in the top tier of fundraising businesses.\n",
